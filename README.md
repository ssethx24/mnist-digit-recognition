# MNIST Digit Recognition

A deep learning project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a CNN to achieve ~98% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. Key steps include data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Graphviz (for visualizing the model architecture)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ssethx24/mnist-digit-recognition
   cd mnist-digit-recognition
